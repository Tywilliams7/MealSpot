# MealSpot
This is a website for people who want to learn how to cook healthy foods and for those who want to eat healthy but don't have time to cook.
Users will be able to choose between two categories: Recipes and Restaurants. 
Depending on what they pick, they will have a search bar where they can type any kind of food or cuisine they want (using keywords).
Once the results appear, the users can pick one of the suggested recipes or restaurants respectively.
After making their selection, they will have the choice to add it to their calendar if they please so they can re visit it whenever they want.
Simple, easy to use, and effective.
